HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRANKIE!!!!
I wish you a happy 19th and offer you this among other gifts to start you
on a journey to building the future as it should be, not as it is.
No one else can or will build the future YOU want to live in.

This is a software that utilizes hand tracking to maneuver the mouse, 
click/drag, and expand the windows in your device

It can be used to build out into other applications, both hardware and software
(think jarvis/cad software)

The software requries you set up an IDE (I recommend VScode) and download some
libraries using your computer's "terminal"

Instructions for setup:

1.) Install VScode
2.) Open your computer's terminal, or the VScode terminal
3.) Install pip (a google search or AI query will help you with this)
4.) Use the command 'pip install _____' to install the required libraries (the underlined libraries at the top of each file)
5.) Press play at the top of VScode main.py to run the program

I will add updates to my github page, check out code4me2 if you want to see what else I do.
This version is a gift for you -- it's not perfect but it is meant to be exciting.

REMEMBER:
    you are the master of your destiny, the captain of your soul
    Things are more interconnected than they seem
    Build from your heart, not on what other people expect from you
